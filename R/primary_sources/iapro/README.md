## Structure
Check out the file `schema.sql` for all the fields in the DB. Additional notes [here](https://geeky.sandcats.io/shared/2BXf2eVLUJFon2kn0_n8MeQ9se5BkBNs2W2LJP3YdOT).

## Restoring a clone
If you received a copy of the DB in `.bak` format then follow [these instructions](clone.md) to import it.
