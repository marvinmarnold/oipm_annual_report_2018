							<li>The top 10 officers are responsible for a little over 11% of all force incidents
(FTN) in 2018, up from 10.3% in 2017.</li>
							<li>The top 10 officers are responsible for just over 14% of all force (UOF) in 2018.
This is a small increase from 13.4% in 2017.</li>
							<li>About the same number of officers used force in 2018 as in 2017.</li>

				<p>OIPM was not able to provide the divisions and districts corresponding to these
officers. In the 2017 report, we found that many of the officers that use the most force
are in divisions like Special Operations that are put into more interactions where force
is used. Different districts also have different patterns of criminal activity that could
effect policing.</p>
