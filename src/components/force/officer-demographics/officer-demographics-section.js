							<li>Use of force varies greatly by age group. Officers ages 26-35 account for more
UOF than all other groups combined but are only about 24% of officers. Within
the 26-30 and 31-35 groups, officers with less than 5 years of experience are most
likely to use force.</li>
							<li>The oldest (51 or older) NOPD officers are least likely to use UOF. They account
for over 30% of officers but have the second fewest force incidents.</li>
							<li>The youngest officers account for just under 9% of all UOF but they comprise 4%
of officers. Relative to the number of officers, the youngest officers do use a
disproportionate amount of force.</li>
							<li>Starting around age 30, many officers with more than 5 years of experience use
force at non-negligible rates.</li>
