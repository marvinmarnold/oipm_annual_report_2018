							604 incidents. The trend of UOF in other police departments surveyed was an
							increase in 2018.</li>
							<li>102 of the reduction in UOF may be attributed to the change of policy no longer
							requiring the reporting of exhibition of taser as a UOF, based on projections
							using 2016 and 2017 averages. This represents 22% in the decline of UOF. See
							narrative under Figure 5 for further explanation.</li>
							<li>Notably, even with the increase of UOF in other cities, the overall numbers for
							UOF per capita in New Orleans was substantially higher than other cities. For
							example, Indianapolis Police Department has 896 UOF and a population of
							863,000, and DC PD had 323 UOF with 694,000 residents.</li>
							<li>Data showed that UOF and FTN remained fairly consistent from 2013 to 2014.
							However, force spiked between 2014 and 2015. From 2015 to 2016, UOF
							increased while FTN decreased. In 2017, both FTN and UOF increased. Notably,
							both UOF and FTN experienced sharp declines in 2018.</li>
