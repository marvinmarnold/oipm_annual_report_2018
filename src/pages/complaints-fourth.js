						<p>Search and seizure and handcuffing and restraint were the two high risk allegations that composed Fourth
Amendment allegations. According to NOPD data, illegal search and seizure was more prevalent than
handcuffing and restraints in 2018 at 85.4% of allegations. There were 29 total Fourth Amendment sustained
allegations in 2018.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, NOPDâ€™s data does not make is easy to identify possible 4 th Amendment related allegations.
Moving forward, NOPD and OIPM will work on this issue together.</p>
						<p>The outcomes of Fourth Amendment allegations were relatively similar for both search and seizure and
handcuffing and restraint. In both instances, the number of sustained allegations matches that of those
exonerated. This is a slight deviation from 2017, when exonerations were nearly twice as likely as sustained
allegations. These findings may indicate a greater accountability mechanism in the department.</p>
